 **<center class="project-title">THE PROBLEM</center> **
The Scene Club  wanted an app to aid in the **promotion of their annual festival**, foster the club's image of creativity and innovation, and create a product that streamlines the exploration, selection, purchase, and check-in process. After conducting some research they have found a large number of their viewers are **Android users**, so they have decided to lead with an Android design.

**<center class="project-title">DISCOVERY</center>**
The phase of discovery was composed of **Ideation Sessions** where assumptions and hypotheses were discussed and created. The involvement of different perspectives like designers, product owners, developers and clients, is very important.

**Assumptions**
The following **business** and **user assumptions** were raised:

They were then classified and distributed in a **grid** that maps certainty and risk:

**User Outcomes**
It was then time to look at the **users' needs** and problems we are trying to solve, look at the user assumptions made and put together a list of user outcomes:

**Business Metrics**
Similarly,  taken into consideration the business assumptions, **metrics** were raised in order to measure the user outcomes and their success:

**Proto-Personas**
After the definition of the User Outcomes and Business Metrics, the sessions focused on proto-personas. Proto-personas are the models of the users that will have the assumed needs and want the created outcomes.

**Features**
It was then time to take a look at the assumptions, review the desired outcomes, relate them to the personas and their needs, behaviours and potential solutions and start suggesting and discussing features:

**Hypothesis**
The last piece of this discovery phase, was the conception of the **hypothesis**. Using the outcomes, metrics, personas and features  as building blocks, the following testable hypotheses were created:

**<center>IMPLEMENTATION</center>**
**User Journeys**
Creating user journeys is a great way to materialise the hypothesis into a mobile user interface.
These user journeys are created to address each of the personas' needs:

Chloe's Journey

1. Quickly choose a recommended film
2. Possibly filter by genre
3. Book tickets through the app
4. Book multiple tickets
5. Get into the theatre through the app

John's Journey

1. Explore films in many ways as possible
2. See detailed info about each film
3. Check reviews
4. Create his own personalised playlist and schedule
5. Share content on social networks

(…row)
(row…)
The following **wireframes** were then created to address these two journeys' requirements:
(…row)
**<center>Chloe's Journey</center>**

<center>(image: chloe-journey-2.png width: 1000)</center>

**<center>John's Journey </center>**

**<center class="project-title">OUTCOMES</center>**
**Visual Designs**
The wireframes were then translated to visual designs. As it was an Android app, it was important to use and follow the **Material guidelines**. However, there was an effort to keep the club's identity in the app, and have a bit of **visual disruption** to stray away from generic Material apps.

As the visuals are targeted for an application it was essential to build a **Style Guide**, to act as a reference for developers and also for future iterations.
